# DTSA-5511 Final Project

# Introduction
The Fruits-360 dataset is a large collection of images of multiple fruits, vegetables and nuts. With over 94,000 images, this dataset has been designed to help researchers and developers in fields like computer vision and machine learning.

It includes 141 different classes of produce, such as apples, bananas, tomatoes, and much more.

In this dataset, each image is carefully captured at a size of 100x100 pixels. The images are organized into a training set of 70,491 images and a test set of 23,619 images.

The images were filmed using a special setup that involved rotating the fruits in front of a camera to create a clear view of each item. This process, along with an algorithm to improve image quality, ensures that the fruits are shown in a consistent way.

I'm trying to solve the following problem: Build a model that will classify fruits, vegetables and nuts.
